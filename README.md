### Artificial Intelligence for Jump Drive

Part of a series on Board Game AI/Analysis.  The overarching goal is to see if certain popular games, especially those with imperfect
information, can be optimized to a maximally efficient strategy.  

Jump Drive is a card game in which players attempt to gain points through the strategic play of
thematic cards.  Cards have costs, that require the player to discard a number of cards from their hand in order to play.  At the end of
each round, players score either more cards or points according to the cards that have been played over the course of the game.
The game ends when one or more players have scored 50 or more points.
